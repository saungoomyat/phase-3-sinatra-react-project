[Flex] Phase 3 Project

My Daily Schedule

I made a page to show my day to day schedule. With me starting this flex program, my everyday life has been very monotonous
but it is filled everyday. Especially so as I am also a bodybuilder and work full time.
I made this web page to show a little bit of what my week looks like. 
There is an add function so that I can update new activities when plans are made.

To get the backend going, we type the following commands into the terminal,

-bundle install
-bundle exec rake db:seed db:migrate
-rackup config.ru

For the front-end, we open another terminal and cd into the frontend folder, then we type,

-npm install
-npm start

This should get the web page running, pulling data from the backend and displaying it with the frontend.
